# file-uploader

**file-uploader** is a simple fullstack application built with Express + EJS for uploading and managing files. It features user authentication, session handling, and clean server-rendered views using EJS. While intentionally minimal, this project demonstrates key backend concepts: file handling with multer, secure login with passport, and data persistence via Prisma.

## features

- file upload system using `multer`
- EJS templates for server-rendered views
- auth with `passport-local` and `bcrypt`
- session management with `express-session`
- Prisma + Postgres for storage

## tech stack

- **backend**: Node.js + Express
- **auth**: Passport.js (LocalStrategy)
- **DB**: Prisma ORM
- **view engine**: EJS
- **file uploads**: multer

## what I learned

- how to build multi-page apps using EJS
- handling file uploads and saving metadata
- managing user sessions with `express-session`
- integrating `passport` into an Express app
